# FullStackCourse
Course content from the Udemy Full Stack web development bootcamp: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/  <br/>
Most of the coursework is covered by video tutorials. However, the capstone projects are my own code. The code for these are found in the folders Capstone Project 1, Capstone Project 2, etc.   <br/>
As I advanced further in the course and get better, the capstone projects will be more complex.  <br/>

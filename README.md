# FullStackCourse

Course content from the Udemy Full Stack web development bootcamp: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/ <br/>
Most of the coursework is covered by video tutorials. Even though the coursework has solutions, I am watching the videos and taking notes, then figuring out the code by myself for each of them before viewing the solutions. Upon completion of the course, I will upload my handwritten notes. <br/>
As for the capstone projects, those are my own code. The code for these are found in the folders Capstone Project 1, Capstone Project 2, etc. <br/>
As I advance further in the course and get better, the capstone projects will be more complex. <br/>

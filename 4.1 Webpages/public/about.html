<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Aaron Li. I graduated from Stanford computer science specializing in
  AI and I am now looking for a full-time software engineer job. I love learning
  as much as I can about software development. Right now, I'm doing Udemy's full
  stack development course to get better at web development.
